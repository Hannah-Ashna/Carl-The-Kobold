### Brief description: 
It seems that Kenny, the chicken warlock you spoke to double-crossed you and you are now trapped in his dungeon! You will need to navigate your way out all while trying to keep your sanity intact and your health bar looking healthy. With Kenny's minions lurking around almost every corner, will you be the first to survive his dungeon of horrors?
 
### Description of Game Play
When the player first hits play, they are immediately transported into the dungeon. It appears that they are stuck in a dungeon and must find their way out by moving between rooms to hopefully discover the right pathway to the exit. However, what they do not know is that the dungeon map is randomly generated each time they play and so the path out is seldom the same. Behind each door to a new room is the possibility of different enemy and loot combinations. Upon finding an enemy, a battle sequence is initiated, and they must try to defeat the enemy before moving between rooms. Once the enemy is defeated the player can pick up the loot dropped and continue with their adventure. As time goes by within the dungeon, the player will notice their sanity bar is beginning to drop and they must hasten their escape attempt. The game will occasionally drop a consumable which will partially restore a player’s sanity; however, this loot drop is quite rare. When the player finally discovers the exit, they must batle with Kenny in order to obtain their freedom.

The ideal duration for a single game attempt will last for about 15 – 20 minutes per run-through. Hence, the need for pausing and saving the game is not needed. However, will be a bonus feature to be added once the primary gameplay features have been implemented.

### Win Condition:
To win the game, the player must successfully navigate their way through the dungeon-like maze, survive all their battles with dungeon monsters and reach the exit. Throughout the game, they must ensure that their health bar never reaches 0 and that their sanity stays above 30. If they fail to satisfy either of these conditions, they lose the game. The pathway to the exit is randomly generated each time, hence, no two-win scenarios are the same. However, the criteria to win remains constant.

### Lose Condition:
As mentioned above, to lose the game, the player either dies to one of the dungeon monsters while in battle or their sanity goes below 30. Sanity level is based on how long they spend in the dungeon battling monsters. The longer they spend in the dungeon, their sanity level decreases by 0.5.

### Other Details:
The game will encapsulate a variety of elements from different genres such as RPGs and Dungeon Crawlers. The concept of random dungeon generation is derived from the extremely popular, ‘The Binding of Isaac’ pc game which uses random level generation to keep the user’s experience of the game interesting and unique every time.
The target platform for this game will be PC/Laptop. Players will need to use their arrow keys to navigate the game map and their mouse to make menu and option selections. A potential later addition to the game would be to implement a difficulty setting to allow players to change their level of difficulty which will make modifications to how the dungeon map is generated and of how quickly their sanity bar drains. Ideally the harder the difficulty the bigger and more complex the map will be and the higher the chance that their sanity drains before they manage to escape.
